Clojure 101 Course Material, Homework, Etc.
===========================================

RubyLearning offered a free Clojure course recently, and it was
coincidental that I was starting to get interested in learning it, so I
signed up quickly for it.  This project will mainly be used for course
work and anything I experiment with in relation to the course work.

For more information on the course, see the following links (account may
be necessary for some links):

 - [RubyLearning][1]
 - [Clojure 101 1st Batch][2]
 - [Clojure 101 Course announcement, including materials][3]
